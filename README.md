# 🎵 Music Recommendation System (NLP based)

A content-based music recommendation system built using
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on song lyrics.

The system recommends similar songs based on lyrical similarity
using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.

## 🔍 How it works
1. Song lyrics are cleaned and preprocessed
2. TF-IDF is used to convert text into numerical vectors
3. Cosine similarity is used to measure similarity between songs
4. Only top-N similar songs are stored for efficiency
5. A Streamlit web interface allows users to interactively get recommendations

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## 🚀 Features
- Fast recommendations using precomputed similarity
- Optimized memory usage
- Simple and clean UI
- Deployable as a web app

## 📌 Use case
This project demonstrates how NLP techniques can be applied
to recommendation systems and can be extended to other
text-based recommendation problems.
